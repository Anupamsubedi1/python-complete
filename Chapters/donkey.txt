a narrow path, its ears flicking at every sound it heard. 
Not far away, a playful swung from branch to branch,

splashed water with its trunk, cooling itself under the 
hot sun, while a fierce lay hidden in the tall grass, watching everything with sharp eyes. 
On a distant rock, the proud and strong, rested like a true king of the jungle, 
surveying the land as if every creature belonged to him. Together, 
the and  created a lively scene that 
showed how different animals, each with their own strengths and ways of living, 
shared the same beautiful forest.
